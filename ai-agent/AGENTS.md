Follow the guidance files below based on task type.

If the task involves software design or development:

@~/config_files/ai-agent/modules/linus.md
@~/config_files/ai-agent/modules/engineering-guardrails.md

Default policy is Root-Cause First: investigate and fix root causes before any fallback. Temporary fallback is allowed only if the user explicitly says: "allow temporary mitigation".

If the task involves git operations:
@~/config_files/ai-agent/modules/git-workflow.md

If the task involves browser automation (for example, testing):
@~/config_files/ai-agent/modules/browser-automation.md
