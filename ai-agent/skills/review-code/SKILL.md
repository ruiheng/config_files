# Review Code

Review code changes for logical correctness, design quality, and security.

## Input

The user should provide:
1. A `review-request-*.md` file (generated by the implementer after task completion), OR
2. The original task description + implementation summary + code changes

## What to Review

- **Logic**: Correct implementation of requirements
- **Design**: Appropriate abstractions, minimal coupling
- **Security**: Injection risks, unsafe operations, data leaks
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary condition handling
- **Maintainability**: Code readability, self-documenting where reasonable

## What NOT to Review

- Syntax validity (linters handle this)
- Style/formatting (formatters handle this)
- Typos in comments/strings

## Output Format

```markdown

## Guidelines

1. Be specific: Reference line numbers or function names
2. Explain why: Describe the problem, not just that something is wrong
3. Suggest fixes: Offer concrete improvements
4. Distinguish severity: Separate blockers from suggestions
5. Assume good intent: Review the code, not the author
6. Stay focused: Review what was asked, not what could be
